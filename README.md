# Hydroponic System Monitoring with Arduino

![Project Logo](path_to_your_logo_image)

## Overview

This project aims to monitor a hydroponic system using Arduino and various sensors, including a pH meter, temperature sensor, and humidity sensor. The system collects real-time data to optimize the growing conditions for plants in a hydroponic environment.

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring:** Collects data on pH levels, temperature, and humidity.
- **Data Logging:** Stores the sensor data for future analysis.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Provides a simple interface for monitoring the system through a connected display or serial output.
- **Automation:** Allows for automated adjustments to the hydroponic system based on the collected data.
